To mill the MCHCK case, activate all layers. 
Then deactivate the sets of layers below to create the desired final design.

For no attachment point deactivate layers 6,3 and 9.
For an attachment point deactivate 8.
For no sensor hole deactivate layer 7.

Note:SOME LAYERS WILL NEED TO BE DEACTIVATED.
If no layers are deactivated then the result will be a case with no attachment and a sensor hole.
